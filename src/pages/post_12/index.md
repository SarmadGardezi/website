This includes a series of incidents that contributed to my frustration while following up on my interview results.

##WEEK 1:

- **03/Apr/2019** (WED)  - Referred by My Friend to apply for the Job.

- **04/Apr/2019** (THU)  - I was asked to fill the details for the Job in the Job portal.

- **05/Apr/2019** (FRI)  - Scheduled Exploratory Call with the company on confirming my availability and my hiring manager's availability.

- **08/Apr/2019** (MON)  - As Scheduled the Exploratory call happended on 3PM.

##WEEK 2:

- **10/Apr/2019** (WED)  - Received a call from the HR saying I cleared the Exploratory Call Round and was asked when can I come over for an F2F.I informed that I can come on Friday(**12/Apr/2019**).And the Interview was scheduled.

- **12/Apr/2019** (FRI)  - The Day of Interview. 3 Rounds were done that day and I was told I am good to leave for the day as all rounds are done and that, the results will be announced on Monday(**15/Apr/2019**).

- **15/Apr/2019** (MON)  - (Follow Up 1) I asked about the status of the Interview and they shocked me with a phone cal where I was called again for another round inspite of informing me on friday that all my rounds were done.I agreed to come there to take the "Missed next round" of my interview on the very next day.

- **16/Apr/2019** (TUE)  - I had my Interview scheduled between 11:30AM and 12:30PM. But unfortunately the panel was able to make it to the interview by 12:45PM and the interview went on till 2PM. Post Interview I was told I ll be told about my Result tomorrow(**17/Apr/2019**) or on Monday(**22/Apr/2019**)

##WEEK 3:

- **17/Apr/2019** (WED)  - (Follow up 2) Asked the Interview Status through emailing the HR.But **No Response**

- **22/Apr/2019** (MON)  - (Follow up 3) Called the HR over the mobile and she did not attend my call or texted me back. (Follow up 4)  So I emailed her again for my Interview Status. She replied back saying that they will let me know the result by tomorrow(**23/Apr/2019**)

- **23/Apr/2019** (TUE)  - (Follow up 5) Asked the Interview Status through emailing the HR, and again **No Response** :)

##WEEK 4:

- **24/Apr/2019** (WED) - (Follow up 6) Called her again to know the interview status.But the HR became "Busy" as indicated by the IVR. (Follow up 7) So, Emailed again and told my current situation to my friend who referred me.  (Follow up 8) He followed up with the hiring manager the very same day and told me that my Role is under review. Later that day, the HR called me and told the same words that my hiring manager sent over the email. Also indicating that interview results were positive but position is what they are not sure about.I was told that I can expect an update by next Tuesday(**30/Apr/2019**)/Wednesday(**1/May/2019**).

- **25/Apr/2019** - **01/May/2019** - Waited with patience.

##WEEK 5:

- **02/May/2019** (THU) -  (Follow up 9) Emailed the HR again. There was a surprise waiting for me. I could not mail the HR (Unable to deliver the email to the recipient). So, I informed about this to my friend who referred me. (Follow up 10) He emailed the HR and the hiring manager stating the issue. Few Hours back **a new HR** called me saying that she will be taking care of this process as the other HR was not available. And she said that my role was still not confirmed and she does not know if the interview result was positive(OMG). And the new HR needed another couple of days to confirm.

- **03/May/2019** (FRI) :
  * (Follow up 11) I reminded her in the morning to confirm by 3PM over.
  * (Follow up 12) As there was no response at all, I called her post 3PM and she said I got selected and they need some docs for which they will be sending over an email immediately.
  * (Follow up 13) As I did not receive the email for few hours I asked her to send them again.
  * Since there was no mention of my role i asked her about it and she called and said about my role and had an HR round in that call.

- **06/May/2019** (MON) -  (Follow up 14) Emailed her again asking about my offer and no response again.
